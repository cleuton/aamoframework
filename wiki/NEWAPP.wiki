#summary How to create a new AAMO app

= Introduction =

An AAMO application is composed by an interface file (ui.xml) and some Lua event handlers (*.lua). Write your files and test in the platform you want. To install your app in a platform: 

AamoDroid: create an "app" folder inside "assets" folder and paste your files there.
AamoiOS: create an "app" group inside your project folder and paste your files there.


Please, see the sample application inside both platforms.

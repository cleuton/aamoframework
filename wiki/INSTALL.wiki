= Mac OSX and Linux users =

Mac OSX and linux users already have a complete POSIX environment, so, they can compile the Lua and LuaJava code using NDK. 

Mac OSX users can build both versions (Android and iOS). Linux users can build only the Android version.

To use the framework "as is" is not necessary to run ndk-build again. Linux users can build the Android version, in which all communication Lua -> Java is done by the "LuaJava" library, so, it is not necessary to change any native code.

= Microsoft Windows users =

Windows users can only build the Android version, in which all communication Lua -> Java is done by using "LuaJava" library, so it is not necessary to run ndk-build again.

But, if you changed anything in the native code modules, you will have to run ndk-build again. In order to run ndk in a windows platform, you must have CYGWIN installed.

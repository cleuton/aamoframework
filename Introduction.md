# AAMO #

AAMO means "moon" in the Xavante language (A Brazillian indian nation).


# What does AAMO do? #

AAMO is a frammework to develop mobile applications for multiple platforms.

It has a common and simple API to describe the user interface elements (screens and controls), and uses Lua scripts to process events. It is an event-based frammework.

First describe your screen, using a simple and abstract XML file, then create scripts to handle UI events, like: load, click etc.


# Why Lua? #

Lua is a simple yet powerful scripting language, used in many frammeworks and commercial produducts.

# How does it work? #

You create your UI and Event scripts, then you can embeed them in "Cradle projects" that AAMO provides to you. Currently we have cradles for Android and iOS, but we are developing for other platforms, like Desktop (Java Swing), BlackBerry, and Windows Phone.


# Bottom line? #

Create mobile apps easier and faster than using native code (Dalvik, Objective C etc), and your apps will be multiplatform!
